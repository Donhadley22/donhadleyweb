<h2>14. Battle of Plataea (479 BC)</h2>
<p>
    In the summer of 479 BC, a large Persian force led by King Xerxes invaded Greece. 
    The Greeks tried to hold the Persian force with 300 Spartiates and 7,000 hoplites 
    under the leadership of King Leonidas in a narrow pass.
    Despite the gallant efforts of the Spartans, Persia conquered Thermopylae and had
    several victories in Artemisium, Thessaly, Boeotia, Euboea, and Attica.
    However, the Persians lost the Battle of Salamis. Then Xerxes retreated and returned 
    to Asia with half of his army. He put Mardonius in charge in Boeotia.

<h2>13. Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC)</h2>

<p>
    In the summer of 480 BC, an unparalleled Greek force of 7,000 men, led by King Leonidas
    of Sparta, blocked the outnumbered Persian army at the pass. The Greeks held off the 
    Persians for seven days in three vicious battles, often epitomized as famous last-stand 
    battles in history. Leonidas blocked the road with his troops for two days, this road 
    being the one and only way for the Persian army to pass. After the continuous two-day 
    battle, Greek resident Ephiatles revealed a secret pass through which the Persian army 
    could enter. Leonidas, with his 300 Spartans and several other Thespians and Thebans 
    died a glorious death at the pass.

<p>
    The southern warlords had 50,000 soldiers altogether, including 30,000 trained naval 
    soldiers led by Zhou. Despite the low numbers of soldiers, Zhou Yu and Lu Su were 
    able to capitalize on the disadvantages of Caoâ€™s army. The biggest disadvantage Cao 
    Cao faced was the lack of stable rear supplies, and the fact that many of the soldiers 
    were inexperienced in naval warfare.
